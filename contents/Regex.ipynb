    "# Regular expressions `⎕R` `⎕S`\n",
    "\n",
    "`⎕R` and `⎕S` are Dyalog's [regex operators](http://help.dyalog.com/latest/index.htm#Language/System%20Functions/r.htm); and take note that they are _operators_, not functions. Occasionally, their operator syntax has unexpected consequences, so it is important to remember this. They are dyadic operators. The left operand is always a character scalar, vector, or vector of such. The right operand may also be any of those, but can also be a function (any type; tacit, dfn or trad), and `⎕S` can also take a scalar integer as right operand.\n",
    "\n",
    "They then derive an ambivalent function which is can be named or applied to text. Some of their behaviour can be modified with the ⍠ operator, but since operators can only take functions (or arrays) as operands, `⍠` will be acting on the derived function, not on `⎕R` or `⎕S` themselves. This may sound trivial, but you have to remember that you cannot make a case insensitive (more about that later) version of `⎕S` with `MyRegexMachine←⎕S⍠1`, only `MyRegexMachine←'something'⎕S'something else'⍠1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic use\n",
    "\n",
    "Final note before we really start: The regex flavour is PCRE, which is well documented, so we won't go too much into details about it. It is [summarised](http://help.dyalog.com/latest/index.htm#Language/Appendices/PCRE%20Regular%20Expression%20Syntax%20Summary.htm) here and described in detail [here](http://help.dyalog.com/latest/index.htm#Language/Appendices/PCRE%20Regular%20Expression%20Details.htm).\n",
    "\n",
    "`⎕R` (Replace) changes text in-place and returns the entire amended argument. `⎕S` only returns the amended match(es). In most other aspects, they are identical, so when we speak of one, it applies to the other unless otherwise noted.\n",

    "Notice how this matched `g P` even though its first two letters were already found in the first match. `⎕R` cannot allow overlapping matches because that may lead to infinite substitution looping: `'x' ⎕R 'xx'⍠'OM' 1` would loop forever. In `xyz` it would first replace `x` with `xx` to get `xxyz` then continue at the next character, which also matches, and makes `xxxyz`, etc. \n",

    "Arguably the most powerful feature of them all is the fact that the right operand may be any monadic (or ambivalent) function. The right argument (which may of course be ignored) will be a namespace with a few members. This namespace survives between matches for the entire time that the current `⎕R/⎕S` call is ongoing, so you further populate the namespace and so use it to convey information from earlier matches to later matches. The only names that are reserved (i.e. get overwritten each time your operand function is called) are: \n",
