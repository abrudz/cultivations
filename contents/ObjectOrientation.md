# Object-oriented APL

Dyalog has rich support for object-oriented programming in APL. If you are familiar with C# or Java OOP you'll find this very familiar. Dyalog APL is an official (i.e. listed by Microsoft as a) .NET language and the object orientation is well aligned with C#. This also means that it's easy to call Dyalog from other .NET languages.
