# Primitive functions

A _primitive function_ is a function defined by the language. Outside of the array community, such functions may be called "builtin" or "intrinsic" functions. In APL, each is represented with a single [glyph](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Glyph); in other languages, such as those restricted to [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) characters, they may use multiple characters ("bigraphs" and "trigraphs" are combinations of two and three characters, respectively). Other parts of APL which are written with a single glyph include [primitive operators](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Primitive_operator) and [Quad](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Quad_name).

A function is distinct from the glyph used to denote it. Different APLs, or even one APL (using [migration level](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Migration_level)) might use the same glyph for multiple functions, or different glyphs for identical or similar functions. The term "function" can, depending on context, refer either to an [ambivalent](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Ambivalent) function which can be applied with one or two arguments, or the [monadic](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Monadic) or [dyadic](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Dyadic) function obtained by restricting that function to either one or two arguments specifically.
